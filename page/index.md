Ebook Translator is a Calibre plugin to translate your ebook into a specified language (optionally keeping the original content).

When reading a foreign ebook/document/file, it can be frustrating to switch back and forth between a translation tool and the reading material. Ebook Translator offers a convenient solution to obtain all translated text, with or without original paragraph, in a single click. This can be a good assistant for reading and translation work.

With the huge ebook formats supported by Calibre, and the huge number of languages supported by translation engines, we can put almost any ebook format to translate and output as any format we like. For example, you can put TXT and get TXT/EPUB translation, or put PDF and get PDF/DOCX translation.
